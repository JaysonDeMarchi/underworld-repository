### What is this application for? ###

This Discord bot runs the faction cup in General GEEGA's Discord server.
- !points command allows GEEGA and Colonels to add/remove points to users or factions
- !overview outputs the current faction standings
- !leaderboard outputs the top 10 users with the most points in the current period
- !restart outputs the final cup standings and user leaderboard. It then begins a new points period.

### How do I get set up? ###

This bot should be given a home on a server somewhere. It should mostly just work through npm.
